      <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
      <p>SCP-003 must be constantly heated, ideally above 100Â°C. Contact with complex organisms is strictly forbidden.</p>
      <p>In case of power failure, personnel must maintain skin contact with SCP-003-1 until temperature rises. Sterilization is mandatory before and after contact.</p>

    <section class="description">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>SCP-003 consists of two parts: SCP-003-1, a biological motherboard, and SCP-003-2, a rune-covered stone tablet.</p>
      <p>SCP-003-1, made of hair, nails, and chitin, predates known circuit boards. It's sentient but not actively dangerous unless conditions change.</p>
      <p>Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.</p>

        <p>SCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times.</p>

    <section class="activation">
      <h2>Activation and Growth</h2>
      <p>When cold, SCP-003-1 grows rapidly, converting its surroundings into its own material. It first forms a brittle star shape, then adapts based on encountered organisms.</p>
      <p>SCP-003-2 emits radiation to control SCP-003-1's growth. Analysis suggests a connection to an LK-class restructuring event.</p>

    <section class="addendum">
      <h2>Addendum 003-04: Breach Event</h2>
      <p>During research, SCP-003-1 breached containment and formed a humanoid shape. It attempted communication before being recontained.</p>
      <p>[DATA EXPUNGED] An unknown individual claiming O5-10 authorization arrived and interacted with SCP-003-1. [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
