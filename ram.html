      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>SCP-005 resembles a seemingly ordinary key from the 1920s. Despite its unassuming appearance, it possesses the remarkable ability to unlock any form of lock, mechanical or digital.</p>
      <p>The Foundation acquired SCP-005 after a civilian used it to breach a high-security facility. The origin and nature of this anomalous ability remain unknown.</p>

      <h2>Containment Procedures</h2>
      <p>While SCP-005 poses no immediate threat, its unique properties necessitate restricted access. Level 4 personnel authorization is required for removal from its containment locker.</p>
      <p>SCP-005 can be used as a substitute for lost security passes, but only under Level 4 supervision. It is strictly forbidden for vending machine repairs, locker access, or personal use.</p>
      <p>Removing SCP-005 from the facility grounds will result in immediate termination.</p>

      <h2>Appendix A: Sentient Properties?</h2>
      <p>Despite its success rate, experiments reveal limitations. When subjects couldn't identify a disguised lock, SCP-005 failed to unlock it roughly 50% of the time. This suggests a form of sentience, prompting further research into its cognitive capabilities.</p>
      <p>However, no evidence suggests SCP-005 recognizes specific locks; only that heavy concealment seems to hinder its effectiveness.</p>
