      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property of "health".</p>

       <P> Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings: the ability to regenerate DNA damaged by sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities in the repair of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon testing the liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents were destroyed immediately. Many reptiles and birds were unaffected, while higher primates experienced the same benefits as humans.</p>

      <h2>Containment Procedures</h2>
      <p>While SCP-006 itself poses no immediate danger, secrecy is paramount. Personnel interaction requires modified Class VI BNC suits and specific briefings (Material SCP-006A for O5 clearance only).</p>
      <p>Procedures are heavily monitored. In case of accidental contact, "Procedure 006-Xi-12" (simulated high toxicity) is announced for evacuation.</p>
      <p>Liquid extraction needs approval from three O5 personnel and utilizes specialized Quad-Sealant Containers under armed guard.</p>
      <p>Personnel exposed to SCP-006 are quarantined for study before incineration (most effective termination method).</p>

      <p>A chemical factory disguise conceals SCP-006's true nature. Foundation and/or Russian-controlled laborers maintain the facade to prevent unwanted attention.</p>
