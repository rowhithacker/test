      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>SCP-004 consists of an old wooden door (SCP-004-1) and twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13). The door leads to an abandoned factory with anomalous properties.</p>
      <p>The keys must be handled with strict procedure. Only Level 4 personnel can use them outside the testing area. Unauthorized removal leads to termination.</p>

      <h2>Effects of SCP-004</h2>
      <p>Using the wrong key (except SCP-004-7 or SCP-004-12) tears subjects apart. Body parts vanish except for a few, scattered across vast distances, some appearing years later.</p>
      <p>SCP-004-7 leads to an impossibly large space. SCP-004-12 causes catatonia and visions of a giant green creature.</p>
      <p>SCP-004 creates space-time anomalies. Time seems to run slower inside, and personnel report missing time.</p>

    <section class="containment">
      <h2>Containment Procedures</h2>
      <p>SCP-004-1 is kept locked. Level 1 clearance allows basic access, Level 4 for key usage.</p>
      <p>In case of breach, the keys must be secured inside before activating the on-site warhead.</p>

      <h2>Appendix: Additional Information</h2>
      <h3>SCP-004-14</h3>
      <p>A large wooden box discovered later, unlocked by SCP-004-7 and some "unsafe" keys. Its inner space is much bigger than the exterior. Objects vanish when the locked box is closed.</p>
